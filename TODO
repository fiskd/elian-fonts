## Standard ##

* That damn ampersand
* Glyph spacing (elian_cc is /not/ monospaced: the dimensions are 750x700; it should probably be refactored to use a square glyph size)
NOTE: Correct em scaling is desc=w/5 asc=w-desc (e.g. w=750: desc=150, asc=600), thus the current sizing is incorrect

## Standard-extended ##

* Clone font into elian_cc_ext, replace numerals (G3.3 for 0, and G4+LM for 1-9)
